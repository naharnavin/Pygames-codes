# Sorting Alorithms Visualization

This is my first ever project made in python using pygame library.
<p>
It sort bars on the basis of there height and the red colour bar mean how is the algorithm working.
<p>
In this program I have included some of the basic sorting algorithms like:-
<p>
<ol>
  <li>Bogo Sorting</li>
  <li>Odd Even Sorting</li>
  <li>Comb Sorting</li>
  <li>Bubble Sorting</li>
  <li>Cocktail Sorting</li>
  <li>Selection Sorting</li>
  <li>Insertion Sorting</li>
  <li>Quick Sorting</li>
  <li>Merge Sorting</li>
</ol>

<p>
I did learned about sorting alogrithms. Though code might seem to be little crazy as I was a noob at that time. Might fix it some day.
